Thanks to my training by and for research, I learnt how to implement innovative but pragmatic solutions to complex problems. My post-doctoral experiences have been the occasion of fruitful collaborations in order to meet the new needs of administrations in terms of decision support informed by data sciences. Today, my ambition is to take part in the challenges of conquering new territories and innovating in a collaborative and friendly team.

## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Experiences 

**Assistant to the head of the "Industry \& Innovation" office"** @ [French Tresory](https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/) _(Sept 2021 - Now)_<br>

Administrations are looking to modernize and have new needs in understanding the financial issues faced by universities. I am building an analytical framework to document the efficiency of universities and thus optimize their operations. This project relies on the matching of several administrative databases and provides new visualizations of metrics by clustering methods, thus highlighting new stylized facts.

**Doctorat (PhD)** @ [GREDEG / UCA&CNRS](https://gredeg.univ-cotedazur.fr) _(Sept 2015 - Dec 2020)_<br>

This doctoral research focuses on the role of economic integration networks (exchange of goods and knowledge) in the growth and agglomeration of activities in Europe. The results obtained are based on parametric and non-parametric models at the frontier between common factor models and spatial econometric models on panels

:woman_teacher: During this period, I was **responsible for teaching** (tutoring) of
- "Introduction to econometrics (t-tests, ANOVA)" (in L3 ; 2015)
- "Statistics 1 (means, conditional statistics...)" (in L1 ; 2018)
